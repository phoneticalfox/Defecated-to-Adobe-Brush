# Defecated to Adobe Brush

## Introduction

"Defecated to Adobe" is a Krita plugin that provides a vector brush tool similar to Macromedia Flash 8's brush tool, including pressure sensitivity and automatic line smoothing. This tool is a humorous nod to the legacy of Macromedia Flash, offering a middle finger to Adobe's monopolistic practices.

## Installation

- Python 3
- PyQt5
